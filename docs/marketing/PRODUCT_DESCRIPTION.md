## Long Description (200 words)

In today's hyper-connected world, managing hundreds of professional relationships is overwhelming. Spreadsheets fail, memory fades, and important connections slip through the cracks. Personal Network CRM solves this with AI-powered relationship intelligence.

Our platform automatically imports your contacts from Google, Microsoft 365, and email, intelligently detects duplicates, and organizes everything in one place. But we go beyond basic contact management. Our AI analyzes your communication patterns, relationship strength, and networking history to proactively suggest who to contact and when. Get reminders before relationships fade, discover the best time to reach out, and receive context-aware suggestions like "congratulate on new role" or "follow up on project discussion."

Search your network naturally with queries like "people in tech hubs I met at conferences" using our semantic search powered by advanced AI. Track email interactions automatically, see complete relationship timelines, and never miss a follow-up with smart, customizable reminders.

Built for privacy-conscious professionals, we're GDPR compliant with optional end-to-end encryption, EU data residency, and transparent data policies. Your network is valuable – we help you nurture it effortlessly.
